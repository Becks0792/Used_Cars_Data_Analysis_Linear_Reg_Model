**Overview of the Project :**

**Data Selection and Source:**
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contained details on used cars listed from 1983 to 2020, including brand, model, fuel type, mileage, engine, max power, and selling price.

**Process Followed :**

- **Data Cleaning**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Hypothesis Testing**

- **Model Building - Linear Regression**


**Key Tools and Techniques Used:**
- **R Programming:** Utilized for all statistical analysis and modeling.

- **Libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr:** For data manipulation and visualization.

**Outcomes & Insights:**
- The project successfully cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, providing insights into factors that significantly affect the selling price of used cars.
  
- **Distribution Insights:** Analyzed the distribution of selling prices, car age, and mileage, highlighting that most used cars sold were cheaper and newer.

- **Correlation Analysis:** Identified strong correlations between selling price and car features like max power, engine size, and torque.
  
- **Categorical Impact:** Explored how categorical variables such as transmission type, fuel type, and seller type affect the selling price, finding that automatic and diesel cars often command higher prices.

- **Trend Analysis:** Revealed trends over the years, such as the increasing popularity of automatic cars and their impact on market prices.

- **Manufacturer Insights:** Determined the popularity and average selling prices of different car manufacturers, providing insights into consumer preferences on the Car Dekho platform.

**Linear Regression Model Results:** Two models were evaluated:
- Model 1: Focused on numerical attributes, explaining 57% of the variance in the selling price.
- Model 2: Combined numerical and categorical attributes, substantially improving the explanation of variance to 85%.
- This model demonstrated that features like max power, engine size, car age, as well as manufacturer and transmission type, are significant predictors of the selling price.

- This insight can aid platforms like Car Dekho in enhancing their pricing strategies and operational decisions
